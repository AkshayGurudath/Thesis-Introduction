We present a vision-based system that simultaneously locates where pedestrians are in the scene, estimates their body pose and predicts their intention to cross the road. Given a single image, our proposed neural network is designed using a bottom-up approach and thus runs at nearly constant time without relying on a pedestrian detector. Our method jointly detects human body poses and predicts their intention in a multitask framework. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the precision scores of the state-of-the-art for the task of intention prediction by approximately 20\% while running in real-time (5 fps). The source code is publicly available so that it can be easily integrated into an ADAS or into any traffic light management systems.},

We formulated the problem as a multi-task learning (MTL) image classification problem and we utilized a convolution neural network (ConvNet) based technique to exploit the commonality between two of the most important attributes of VRUs for intent prediction models (i.e, head orientation and body posture). We achieved classification accuracy scores of 83\% and 76\% for the body posture and head orientation attributes respectively. We compared the performance of our proposed solution against individual single task learning ConvNet models for each attribute and achieved significant overall accuracy over the two attribute classification tasks. Furthermore, we compared our proposed MTL-ConvNet model against other MTL approaches and achieved more than 18\% AP score improvement in the classification of body posture attribute.},

The technique was applied to experimental data from an instrumented vehicle that included both behavioral data and environmental data. Comparing these results to recent results using a novel ?mind-tracking? technique, we found that SVMs outperformed earlier algorithms and proved especially effective in early detection of driver lane changes.},

	abstract = {In the context of driver assistance, an accurate and reliable prediction of the vehicle's trajectory is beneficial. This can be useful either to increase the flexibility of comfort systems or, in the more interesting case, to detect potentially dangerous situations as early as possible. In this contribution, a novel approach for trajectory prediction is proposed which has the capability to predict the vehicle's trajectory several seconds in advance, the so called long-term prediction. To achieve this, previously observed motion patterns are used to infer a joint probability distribution as motion model. Using this distribution, a trajectory can be predicted by calculating the probability for the future motion, conditioned on the current observed history motion pattern. The advantage of the probabilistic modeling is that the result is not only a prediction, but rather a whole distribution over the future trajectories and a specific prediction can be made by the evaluation of the statistical properties, e.g. the mean of this conditioned distribution. Additionally, an evaluation of the variance can be used to examine the reliability of the prediction.},

Any autonomous vehicle navigating such a scene should be able to foresee the future positions of pedestrians and accordingly adjust its path to avoid collisions. This problem of trajectory prediction can be viewed as a sequence generation task, where we are interested in predicting the future trajectory of people based on their past positions. Following the recent success of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models for sequence prediction tasks, we propose an LSTM model which can learn general human movement and predict their future trajectories. This is in contrast to traditional approaches which use hand-crafted functions such as Social forces. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several public datasets. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on some of these datasets . We also analyze the trajectories predicted by our model to demonstrate the motion behaviour learned by our model.},

One of the main challenges that make this problem even harder is the uncertainty exists in the actions of pedestrians in urban traffic environments, as well as the difficulty in inferring their end goals. In this work, we are proposing a data-driven framework based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and the bidirectional recurrent neural network architecture (B-LSTM) for long-term prediction of pedestrians' trajectories. We evaluated our framework on real-life datasets for agent behavior modeling in traffic environments and it has achieved an overall average displacement error of only 2.93 and 4.12 pixels over 2.0 secs and 3.0 secs ahead prediction horizons respectively. Additionally, we compared our framework against other baseline models based on sequence prediction models only. We have outperformed these models with the lowest margin of average displacement error of more than 5 pixels.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {In the context of intelligent vehicles, we perform a comparative study on recursive Bayesian ﬁlters for pedestrian path prediction at short time horizons ({\textless} 2s). We consider Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) based on single dynamical models and Interacting Multiple Models (IMM) combining several such basic models (constant velocity/acceleration/turn). These are applied to four typical pedestrian motion types (crossing, stopping, bending in, starting). Position measurements are provided by an external state-of-the-art stereo vision-based pedestrian detector. We investigate the accuracy of position estimation and path prediction, and the beneﬁt of the IMMs vs. the simpler single dynamical models. Special care is given to the proper sensor modeling and parameter optimization. The dataset and evaluation framework are made public to facilitate benchmarking.},
